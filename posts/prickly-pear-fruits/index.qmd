Mexico is considered the largest international producer of prickly pear, followed by South American countries such as Chile, Brazil and Argentina where large quantities are also produced. In Europe, Italy is the largest producer, while Morocco is the leading producer in Africa.

The prickly pear is a common fruit in Mexican markets, especially between July and September, which is the peak production period. In 2019 alone, up to 428,300 tons of this sweet delicacy were produced. And although its production is below other fruits such as oranges, bananas and apples, prickly pear fruits can be considered an important source of various nutrients.

Prickly pear pulp is a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A, calcium, potassium and not so well known components such as phenolic compounds, which are known to have several beneficial effects as part of a balanced diet. Its consumption can also be considered as a natural alternative to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels, relieve the discomfort caused by ulcers and help stabilize and regulate blood sugar levels.

Although it is more common to find green prickly pears, there are also yellow, orange, red and purple ones. In these different colored varieties there is a group of compounds called betalains, pigments responsible for conferring the color. As an additional benefit, it is also known that the consumption of betalains can reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the blood.

Prickly pears can be used for the production of juice, jam, vinegar and liquors. From the varieties of different colors are obtained dyes that can be used as an alternative to synthetic dyes in food. The peel of this fruit is usually discarded, but it can also be considered an important source of pigments. Moreover, even edible oil with a high content of beneficial compounds, such as unsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E and vitamin K, can be obtained from the seeds.

As mentioned above, Mexico is the world's leading producer of prickly pear. The main advantage of prickly pear cactus is its low water requirement, which in drought areas makes it a more viable crop than beans and corn. In areas where it is grown extensively, prickly pear cactus is the main source of income for many Mexican families. It is also important to mention that Mexico is the center of origin of the prickly pear, with at least 100 species from which edible fruits can be obtained.
